- The objective is to maximize profits while minimizing customer loss. Given a set S of customers with cardinality n, then for each i-th customer, I have a set $[p_i, \alpha_i, \gamma_i, \beta_i]$. Now, p represents the monthly top-up of a customer i; $\alpha$ represents the churn out probability of a customer i; $\gamma$ represents the acceptance rate of a customer i for a certain offer; $\beta$ represents the probability the customer accepts an offer, that is, for any customer i, $\beta_i = 1 - \exp(\gamma*x_i)$. Given the set of offers $\delta$, where each element $\delta_j$ up to k represents the set of k offers we have, then $x_i$ is defined by the summation of 0 to k of $d_j * x_{i,j}$. A corollary of this is that the total number of offers we have, denoted k, is the cardinality of the set delta. Furthermore, the total budget W we have is the sum of j up to k of $d_j * n_j$, where n is the number of customers for which the offer $delta_j$ is proposed. Finally, the expected revenue of a customer i is represented by the function $f(p_i, \alpha_i, \gamma_i, \beta_i)$. More details on f(args) and the Integer Program in the paper, as well as on how to implement it via a greedy algorithm.
